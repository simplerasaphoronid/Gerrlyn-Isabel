    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it was founded in 1994, Amazon Inc. has quickly expanded outside of its business as an online bookstore and became a corporate behemoth in multiple sectors across the US and globe. Its vast expansion has called for a number of warehouses, logistics subcontractors and new grocery stores that have emerged across the country, and particularly in the Los Angeles and Inland Empire regions. This has, in turn, led to an exponential demand for workers, but unfortunately also a variety of unfair and harsh working conditions. Over the last decade, the media has shown a growing discontent among workers. However, how can we find out more from workers directly about ongoing sentiments for the company? How can we utilize sentiment analyses and topic modeling to do so?"

I worked for them back in 2008 in a distribution warehouse. For a company that was sticklers about employees following safety guidelines, they seem to throw those out the window when the \"rate\" fell below 100%. For people who don't know, you have to work at a certain pace for amazon and make rate or else you are fired, no ifs ands or buts. One day I was doing my job at amazon and when our stock rate fell below 100% my manager had us unpack pallets that were not only unwrapped incorrectly, but the fork lift was still working in the same space. I took a picture of it and showed it to corporate and I got fired for having my cell phone on the floor. Didn't matter why, rules is rules and I got fired and I know for a fact the manager did not. So the moral of this story is fuck amazon and fuck all of the affiliates.

      "I support this! I was a Amazon delivery driver. Just actually quit today after a build up of things finally just hit a nerve. Been with my dsp 3 months. In that 3 months time I've seen alot and learned ALOT. With that said alot of what he's saying are facts! My DSP pays 15 a hour. if your FICO is over 800 for the month and your attendance was good you get an extra 2 dollars an hour for every hour you worked that month to make it like your making 17. Were scheduled 10 hour days but only guaranteed 8 hours pay. Meaning if your day magically is only 6 hours you still get 8 hours pay. If you get done with your route and there's other drivers around you still working you have to do a rescue making your day now longer and so that the majority of the drivers are all back around the same time. Now, that said I've NOTICED some trends. Drivers favored by the dsp get better easier routes. Drivers get rotated between prime branded vans and white vans. Prime vans are monitored WAY more then the white making the white vans easier to get good scores. The rotation seems to always be at the end of the month in attempts I feel to crash your mentor score so they don't have to pay the extra 2 buck a hour. If you don't know the hacks for the day to day ie app hacks you get screwed ALOT and that's where the whole mentor and van rotation come into play BIG TIME. They expect 1 minute per stop which I don't know how the hell they expect that. Unless you want your day to be crazy long and them bitch at you YES I know many guy drivers that either luckily have country routes and pee on the side of the road or... for us city driver its yes you guessed it bottles!!! With covid it created even more of a problem because many places are still not open to public and if they are the bathrooms are not. So all in all for the amount they pay and what they expect its just crazy. Our DSP has had a crap ton of people quit. Rambling aside good luck man and I hope this works for the people still left working for that company.\n",

    "Interestingly, at first glance, we can see that all the topics are much more spread out. This means that they are less related compared to the previous time we plotted topics looking at topic 1 again, when adjusted to lambda = 0.5, there seems to be a more word frequencies that pop up, including a lot of words that perhaps aren't too helpful. In general though, we do seem to draw the same theme of worker discontent. Another interesting observation is that lthough we see that \"warehouse\" and \"driver\" come up here, we know from our sentiment analysis that the Whole Foods Subreddit had the most negative sentiment analysis. Therefore, it's helpful to utilize these methods together to draw conclusions. We can say similar things about other topics. Words like \"pay\", \"support\", \"time\", \"union\", and \"job\" stand out, indicating worker organizing and/or desires for changes in working conditions"

    "#### Contributions:\n",
    "Both team members contributed to analyzing subreddits. Isabel specifically ran code to connect to subreddit’s API, combine subreddits into one notebook, and created charts and other visuals. Since the advice given for this assignment was to run code with a sample of our data and then scale up, Gerrlyn applied our initial code to the other six subreddits to ensure it worked for all of them. She added edits to our list of stop words and provided markdown codes to the notebook as well.\n",

    "#### How we worked together as a team: \n",
    "The timeline for our work would have taken much longer if we did not choose to combine all subreddits threads into one notebook, since we would have had to run the code for separate ones, provide some analysis, and compare outcomes across notebooks. Were that to happen, we would have split notebooks and ran the same codes and analysis for each. However, since we chose to streamline everything, it ended up being best to send an updated notebook back and forth or share added codes via Slack. We also held regular check in’s each week about our project. Because the research topic for this project was based off of our capstone project which we are also working closely on together, this made the planning and analysis process run smoother in many ways. We’re excited to have our analyses for this class contribute to that project as well."
